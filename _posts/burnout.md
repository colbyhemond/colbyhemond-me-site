summary: I thought burnout was normal... at least for people like me. It wasn't until I surrounded myself with open and honest people that I realized I've been killing myself over my work.

Burnout has been a yearly thing for me. At least. It's almost like I operate in cycles and I know its coming but I still can't seem to fully prevent it. I've gotten better over the years, so I can at least be mindful of it, but that doesn't help me stop it from happening. It only helps me realize that I should take a quick break, focus on something different, not be a jerk.

The thing that is hard for me is that I am a hard worker. I feel like in order to keep up with my field I need to keep pushing through with brute force otherwise I'm going to fall behind. I don't think I'm the smartest around me, by far, but that causes me to put in the extra hours so that I can learn the things that I think come quicker to others. 

How am I supposed to get ahead if I just do my job and nothing more? I don't know how to advance if I don't do that. Maybe I need to focus deeper on a specific subject? Take better notes for better recall? Not sure.
