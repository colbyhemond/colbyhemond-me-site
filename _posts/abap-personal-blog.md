There's a time and a place, and the SAP Community Blog is probably not the place.

What am I talking about? I'm talking about putting yourself out there on the internet and trying to share your knowledge or something that you created. You probably went outside of your comfort zone, dipped your toes into abapGit maybe and pulled the abap2excel repository to your system. "Oh cool", you think to yourself, I did somethign new and cool and I'm proud of myself. Maybe I'll write a blog about it. The logical place for an SAP related blog would surely be the SAP Community Website. However this is not place.

It seems as though we need to only post unique and new content to the SAP Community blog because everyone is watching and they do not want to see the same blog topic posted by a thousand people. If you're adding value then I guess it makes sense, but you're probably just trying your hand at blog writing and for once putting yourself out there.

There's other places you can do this and it's super easy.

These are the main points here that we can unpack even further.

# Putting yourself out there on the internet

It's tough, I've created my personal website a handful of time, written many blogs in the past, and they have all vanished into the ether because I didn't migrate them, thinking I need to start fresh, and start better and cleaner and...oh boy was I a fool. I wish I kept a few of those blogs, because the website analytics show that those urls still pop up in my pages not found. I could try and recreate them, but it's just not the same because I really need that mindset that I had 8 years ago when I wrote them.

You definitely should put yourself out there. Start building that electronic paper trail of where you were and in the years to come you will see how much you've learned and see the direction of your career start to shape. I keep kicking myself for not committing to this years ago. I just kept starting and then deleting. Worst mistake ever.

I once wrote up a quick how to article on something I learned and then posted it on dev.to. And it immediately got shared and crapped on by "web dev" experts saying how it's such a horrible fix to implement. That's when I started to learn. I learned that I need to just commit to my own website, and then if I feel an article is worth sharing , then I will distribute or cross post that article. That's at least where I've come to terms early 2023.

# Why not the SAP Community website?

Honestly, the SAP Community blogs are filled with SAP employees posting marketing-ish stuff on new features and products (which is great to learn about those). And Then the occasional helpful article by someone bold enough to share. The community likes to safeguard this and they'll correct you if your are out of line. Which is great, fin, and dandy. But it's hard to know this as someone new to the community until it happens to you or if you follow close enough to see it happen to someone. It would be nice if there was a disclaimer stating this to protect new fragile egos.

Let's let the SAP Community be what it is. As I've heard it's had a downfall since migrating from SCN (SAP Community Network). And really in this day and age I believe you should take ownership of your content. Create your own corner of real estate on the internet and work on yourself first. Write some blogs on your own site, feel free to share those via social media to gain some initial traction. Then when you feel like you've got something quality worth sharing, then cross post on other sites like Hashnode, Dev.to, or even the SAP Community (if the content is new or can really help the community)
