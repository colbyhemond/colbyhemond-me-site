summary: Are you sick and tired of SAP Experts shitting on your abap2excel blog posts? Then do something about it!
---

Are you tired of SAP experts telling you to not post another abap2excel blog post on the SAP community? It's frustrating, right? All you want to do is start sharing your knowledge of when you are learning and creating. And it seem like there is no better place to do that than on the SAP Community blog space.

Let's unpack and clarify a few things first:

**Number 1:** You probably care less about putting out another abap2excel blog, and more about starting to put yourself out on the internet. I get it, it's a scary thing. And unfortuntely some of our first attempts take some of the biggest hits.

**Number 2:** The SAP Community has gone through turbulent times of the past decade. And it's really not the place to post duplicate content or incorrect content. The SAP Experts will let you know.

These are the main points here that we can unpack even further.

# Putting yourself out there on the internet

It's tough, I've created my personal website a handful of time, written many blogs in the past, and they have all vanished into the ether because I didn't migrate them, thinking I need to start fresh, and start better and cleaner and...oh boy was I a fool. I wish I kept a few of those blogs, because the website analysicts show that those urls still pop up in my pages not found. I could try and recreate them, but it's just not the same becasue I really need that mindset that I had 8 years ago when I wrote them.

You definitely should put yourself out there. Start building that elecronic paper trail of where you were and in the years to come you will see how much you've learned and see the direction of your career start to shape. I keep kicking myself for not committing to this years ago. I just kept starting and then deleting. Worst mistake ever.

I once wrote up a quick how to article on something I learned and then posted it on dev.to. And it immeditaely got shared and crapped on by "web dev" experts saying how it's such a horrible fix to implement. That's when I started to learn. I learned that I need to just commit to my own website, and then if I feel an article is worth sharing , then I will distribute or cross post that article. That's at least where I've come to terms early 2023.

# Why not the SAP Community website?

Honestly, the SAP Community blogs are filled with SAP employees posting marketing-ish stuff on new features and products (which is great to learn about those). And Then the occasiaonal helpful article by someone bold enough to share. The community likes to safeguard this and they'll correct you if your are out of line. Which is great, fin, and dandy. But it's hard to know this as someone new to the community until it happens to you or if you follow close enough to see it happen to someone. It would be nice if there was a disclaimer stating this to protect new fragile egos.

Let's let the SAP Community be what it is. As I've heard it's had a downfall since migrating from SCN (SAP Community Network). And really in this day and age, take ownership of your content. Create your own corner of real estate on the internet and work on yourself first. Write some blogs on your own site, feel free to share those via social media to gain some initial traction. Then when you feel like you've got something quality worth sharing, then cross post on other sites like Hasnode, Dev.to, or even the SAP Community (if the content is new or can really help the community)
