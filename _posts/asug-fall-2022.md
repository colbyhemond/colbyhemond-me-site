The ‘Fall 2022’ ASUG New England Chapter Meeting was a wonderful time and had that nice familiar feel to other ASUG meetings. All presentations were given by SAP representatives or sponsoring vendors. Also, an ample amount of giveaways happened throughout the day.

## Overview
There appeared to be about 25–50 attendees, which most stuck around throughout the entire day and into the happy hour at the end of the day.

The middle of the day consisted of breakout sessions split into 2 tracks:
- Data Analytics and Security
- Supply Chain
Additional presentations given at the beginning and end of the day were given by SAP representatives discussing SAP RISE and SAP Signavio.

## Thoughts
The presentations I attended were valuable in exposing the audience to ideas and products that they may not have known existed or how they could be utilized.

### Accelerate your S/4HANA journey with SAP RISE
Having seen and heard the words “SAP RISE” but never doing the research on what it actually is, this presentation was beneficial to get an understanding of what it is and what it offers. Did you know that SAP RISE includes:

### S/4HANA
Business Technology Platform
SAP Signavio
Business Networking
It was mentioned that most customers focus just on S/4HANA and don’t necessarily leverage the other offerings.

### The future of APIA with SAP
APIA is “Accounts Payable Invoice Automation”, and using cool technologies like OCR and Machine Learning it’s possible to automate your invoices, purchase orders, and other documents in addition to proposing approvers and other data, streamlining processes and decisions which gives time back to your users.

### ERP Security 101: 5 Things Every Leader & Organization Should Be Doing to Secure ERP
It important to make sure your web based applications a secured appropriately, but also your backend SAP system should not be ignored. It’s obvious that external bad actors are always trying to compromise company’s systems, but internal employees could also cause harm whether it is on accident or deliberate. Make sure all levels of vulnerabilities are accounted for. Don’t make assumptions, and fill the security gaps.

### Leverage S/4HANA Embedded Analytics for real-time data insights
Fiori offers live data capabilities whether it is just on the main application tiles, or within the applications themselves. You can leverage embedded analytics out of the box by looking for Analytic Applications in the Fiori Application Library, or you can create them yourself by connecting CDS Views and OData services to your own custom Fiori applications

### Accelerate and De-Risk Enterprise Transformation and Process Optimization with SAP Signavio
Think Microsoft Visio meets Real-Time Collaboration. Signavio is a cool tool to document your business processes where your entire team can collaborate, discuss, propose and make changes. You have one source of truth, can comment directly on the processes, and receive a news feed of updates when there are changes in the processes.
