How do you eat a whole elephant? One bite at a time.

Of course this is just a figure of speech, if you have never heard the saying before. It basically means, if something it too big and daunting to take on the entire thing, just break it down into small "bite sized" pieces so that you can focus on completing that tiny piece and start making progress toward completing the entire thing.

The feeling of being overwhelmed by a large task often catches me off guard. I then send my mind spinning for hours or even days feeling overwhelmed and in this sort of state of paralysis where I get absolutely nothing done. I've over come this before, and it's often the same way, but for some reason it takes me a while to get to that solution.

What do I do to fix that overwhelming feeling when I have too big of a task, or too much on my plate to take care of at once? Well I make a list. Then I organize that list. Then I go through the list items and see if I can break any of them out into smaller tasks, then organize those. 

This seems like I'm spending a lot of time just getting organized when I could be getting something done. Well I don't spend long on it, I try to just write down everything that comes to mind quickly. Get organized fast so you can start making progress on the first item quickly.

Once that first item is done, then I get that feeling of accomplishment that I completed something, which helps with motivation to move onto the next task and start building momentum.

I've started to learn to give my self a breather between tasks, or even if I've been working on a task for a little while. To give my mind a break, to recenter and give my self a chance to adjust if I ended up taking on too much at once.... once again.
