There's no better way to learn, than by practicing. The posts linked in this article are going to be a hands on approach to learning about Node.JS from installation to the fundamentals for creating Node.js based applications.

My motivation to start this list of posts is my preparation for the [OpenJS Node.js Application Developer (JSNAD) certification](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnad/). The goal with each post is to learn and reinforce the knowledge through application, by actually developing small projects focusing on each concept.

## Installing Node & Getting Set Up
* [Installing Node via nvm (Node Version Manager)](/posts/installing-node)

## Fundamentals
* [Hello, Node! Getting a feel for some basics](/posts/hello-node)
* [Encoding Base64 - Buffer, Unit Tests, NPM publishing](/posts/encoding-base64)

More on the way!
